# User Research 

## Target Audience 

When I created my storyboard and planned my interview process, I intended for my audience to be education policymakers. I believed that this audience would not only care about educational equity, but that they would have the most power to alter circumstances if inequity did prove to exist. Basically, I wanted an audience that would be able to enforce my calls-to-action. Therefore, it was important to me to get insight from peoople working in the fields of education and/or public policy.

As a former educator myself, I knew that the concepts would interest others in the field. However, I wasn't sure how to properly convey the data via intuitive and logical visualizations. Hence, it was also important to me that at least one of my interviewees had a strong data anlysis and quantitative background.

With these considerations in mind, I selected 3 interviewees: a Title I coordinator at a K-5 school, a grad student in Information Security Policy, and a grad student in Information Systems -- Business and Data Analytics track.

## Interview Script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|Determine if the structure/style/tone matches the intended audience.|Who do you think would be the target audience for this webpage? *follow up:* If the webpage is intended for policymakers, do you have any recommendations for what should be removed, addded, or altered?|
|Determine if the narrative structure is eliciting the intended emotions.|What were some feelings that you had while navigating through the webpage? Were there any specific moments that stood out? If so, what elements elicited those emotions?|
|Determine the effectiveness of the design and organization of the geographical maps about chronic absenteeism and algebra 1 pass rates.|Is the coloring or sizing confusing or helpful in your understanding of the main takeaways? *follow up:* Did you feel that this side-by-side organization helped or hindered your understanding of the main takeaways? If it hindered your understanding, is there an organization that you would find more helpful?|
|Determine the effectiveness of the call-to-action in light of the provided narrative and datapoints.|In your opinion, is the call-to-action section reasonable or adequate in response to the data and the narrative?|
|Ensure that I elicit general feedback in case there are elements that are helpful or confusing that I didn't consider.|Do you have any general feedback before we get into specific questions?| 

For the charts, I was more focused on the geographical maps because I felt that they were the ones I had the most trouble with. While my other charts are more basic (and, therefore, more intuitive to understand), these geographical maps were difficult because I felt that I was using the same structure to represent two different messages: big, dark circles were negative for chronic absenteeism but positive for Algebra I pass rates. While I tried to account for this by chooseing different colors and making clear titles, I still found myself getting confused. Hence, I needed outside input to figure out a way to improve the design.

Ironically, I found that the narrative was actually the part that I was most worried about. While I assumed that the narrative would appeal to the educator, I wasn't sure if it would have the same interest or intrigue for the policy students. I figured that even if the data visualizations were okay, the narrative might not hold the same weight for them. Therefore, a lot of questions ended up being about the story that I was trying to tell about the data more so than the data elements themselves. I think the fact that I kept most of my graphs pretty familiar/basic (line graphs and scatterplots, meant that there would be less confusion about those elements. Instead, I was more concerned with the connection between the narrative structure and the data.

|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
|Do you have any general feedback before we get into specific questions?|I really enjoyed the colorful start because it was engaging and captured my attention. While at first I was confused about all of the colors on the Pittsburgh map, I was qucikly relieved and impressed by the focus on each neighborhood section with the color; it was like they knew the question I had before I had it. Overall, I was left wondering more. The story was interesting and informative, but it led me with many more questions about the district. I also wish that the last Tableau chart wasn't so huge. It takes up the whole screen and I can't see the context alongside it.|There's too to read. Also, the geographical maps were a bit hard to read and I think I could have used a scatterplot in that section to see if there was a trend. Even if there wasn't, that's important to see too. And, this may be out of the scope, but I'd like to know why some of the schools, like Allderdice, are performing much worse. Maybe that can be mentioned as a further research step.|There is a lot of discussion that I don't think you need. The limitations about PPS data don't seem relevant, unless this is a problem statement for some reason. On the other hand, I really liked the quote; they were very impactful for your story. I was really upset about the chart showing historical data on attendance; the need to scroll up and down just annoyed me as a user. Please fix that chart; it was a very sad chart.|
|Who do you think would be the target audience for this webpage? *follow up:* If the webpage is intended for policymakers, do you have any recommendations for what should be removed, addded, or altered?|I think this is for the Pittsburgh community, specifically educators and families with children high school or about to enroll. *Follow-up:* I don't actually think that the policymakers would be really familiar with what these schools are facing on a district level, let alone an individual level. So, they might need much more contextual information. For instance, they might need to know what curriculum is being used or what underlying factors are contributing to the chronic absenteeism. Policymakers might get stuck on these issues without that context, and you'll lose them.|I'm confused because I think it's for policymakers but it reads like an academic paper. *follow up:* I think the tone of the writing should be less exploratory. Just tell them what you need them to know.|It feels like an academic paper, but it is also informative. The call-of-action also feels disperse. I'd say policymakers, but maybe it's the district itself. *follow up:* Be more authoritative in your approach. And, if the audience isn't PPS, then you don't really need to talk about limitations; instead, you can discuss the available data and explain how it was combined to be where you're at. Keep that to 1-2 sentences.|
|What were some feelings that you had while navigating through the webpage? Were there any specific moments that stood out? If so, what elements elicited those emotions?|It was very surprising to me that absenteeism wasn't a major influence for some of the schools' results. I paid more attention to the writing than the chart. I'm not really a chart person and it was a bit difficult to figure out. I was also surprised about enrollment because it wasn't something I thought about but once it was mentioned, it made so much sense. I'm glad they had the chart to show that pattern.|I was surprised that more instructional time didn't lead to better performance, and I was left wondering why. But, then you say it could be an equity issue and that's not explained. So, then I felt like something was missing and I also was left without answers. You should addresss the root cause if you mention that because policymakers might not intuitively know.|I really liked the first quote because it was so relatable. I grew up in California and I was like, "Yeah, I remember hearing things like that too!"|
|Is the coloring or sizing confusing or helpful in your understanding of the main takeaways? *follow up:* Did you feel that this side-by-side organization helped or hindered your understanding of the main takeaways? If it hindered your understanding, is there an organization that you would find more helpful?|I figured that the smaller the circle, the less of something. But I'm not sure if the measurements are percentages or points. So, that's unclear. And I think the color wasn't really intuitive. Red would've helped as an alert for something is bad. In education, red is usually bad and green is good. *follow up:* I liked them side-by-side because I needed to compare these things.|I don't get the colors of the maps, like what is purple supposed to represent? Good or bad? And then, the size changes meaning, so a new blue color doesn't help the situation. *follow up* I'm okay with the organization, but I would like to see a scatterplot next. I think the geography is helpful, but now I need an easier way to see that the association strength, even if there isn't one.|I would change the colors to be green for good and red for bad. That way the bigger circles are clearly bad in the absence chart and the small circles are clearly bad in the Algebra chart. And it makes comparisons between the two charts easier. *follow up* It's fine. I don't have a problem there.|
|In your opinion, is the call-to-action section reasonable or adequate in response to the data and the narrative?|I think both are adequate responses, but I think that they additionally need to do a review of the Algebra curricula at these schools. This way they can ensure that the supports are matching the need and they're not just wasting money where it isn't needed.|The title "call-to-action" feels dramatic to me. I think it's also adrupt. You don't have any transition. You go straight from the problem without a summary or conclusion section. This might seem less dramatic depending on the audience, but that seems like it also needs some better definition. Also, it would be helpful to see some specific Algebra supports listed because it's currently too vague.|It seems like these recommendations might be for two different audiences. Are we talking to policymakers or the distrcit itself? Because I'm not sure who had the ability to actually make these changes or who is responsible for doing so.|

## In-Class Critique Findings

* **Geographic Maps:** The colors are confusing; while you risk the Christmas effect, a red-green spectrum would likely work better, especially in terms of comparisons. Also, the ranges should actually be the same on each chart; currently, they are different, which makes it even more difficult to compare because the sizes aren't consistent. Hence, you run into accuracy/truth issues.
  
* **PPS Neighborhoods:** Currently, the scrollmotion isn't having the impact you intended. Since the images aren't properly aligning with the text, the viewer can't really figure out which schools are in which neighborhoods. Also, I  the South neighborhood doesn't even appear. Instead, you can try using the Scrollpoints feature so that you can highlight each neighborhood based on one map. This will provide a better effect.
  
* **Additional Data:** With the current data, it does seem like this isn't the determining factor. Maybe something about demographics should be considered so that you can better determine the issue and make a better call-to-action.

Based on the in-class critique, I was able to make some adjustments before conducting my interviews:

1. It was a quick fix to sub the scrollpoints feature for the scrollmation feature. This allowed me to more clearly illustrate the PPS neighborhoods and list the schools for each. This improvement actually received good reviews in the interview section.
   
3. Next, I also took the step of looking into demographic information. This is when I noticed the stark differences in enrollment size. While I would have liked to also do a more in-depth breakdown (e.g., ELL status, IEP status, race, and socioeconomic status), I didn't have enough time to make this change. I'm not sure I'll be able to do this in my final version, but I do think that it would be a great addition for further analysis. It could be that the East schools with lower performance is actually due to a lack of other, non-math related supports (e.g., ELL supports or Special Education teachers).

|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|The geographical maps were not clear in their message.|I am going to change these maps to have a red-green scale and they will be reversed (e.g., red small circles on the algebra chart and red, big circles on the chronic absenteeism chart). I will also make it so that the data labels are cohesive between the two charts so that comparisons are accurate. I will likely make the ranges as follows: 0-25%, 26-50%, 51-75%, and 76-100%. This will also account for the issue of missing units, which confused my first interviewee.|
|The target audience may not be correctly identified (or it's unclear).|After my interviews, I also thought that policymakers might not be the correct audience here. This audience would be too broad and probably wouldn't have the authority (or interes) in fixing the PPS district specifically. Hence, I think my audience really is the PPS district. After all, this is the party that would be able to conduct further research comparing school sites and to fund more resources for schools. With this in mind, I will be changing the tone to be less academic/exploratory and more authoritative.|
|The historical chronic absenteeism chart isn't user friendly.|I think this just requires me spending more time trying to condense the chart on Tableau. Or I can figure out if Shorthand has a way to lengthen the embedded chart.|
|The trend of the geographical maps is unclear.|In addition to changing the maps' color scheme, the addition of a scatterplot will help to show that the correlation between absenteeism and Algebra performance is actually much weaker than originally assumed.|
|There is no transition between the last chart takeaway and the call-to-action.|I want to add a conclusion section to wrap up and make it clear what the findings are. This would definitely help orient the district reps right before I lead into the call-to action.|
|The call-to-action is currently too weak and not precise enough.|I need to be clear about expecting PPS to take action, and I need to provide more concrrete action items. For instance, I can discuss specific Algebra 1 supports that can be added. Or for research, I can discuss a comparison of curricula currently in use.|
