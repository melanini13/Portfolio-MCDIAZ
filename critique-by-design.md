# Critique by Design

## Step 1: Choosing a Data Visualization

For this assignment, we were asked to select a data visualization to critique and re-design. Per the professor's suggestion, I selected my data visualization from the [Makeover Monday website](https://makeovermonday.co.uk/).

I selected the visualization ["The Cost of 1GB of Mobile Data in Every Country?"](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/cost-of-mobile-data-worldwide/) which was published July 2020 via Visual Capitalist.

Having spent a substantial amount of time abroad in Spain and Italy, I was interested in the subject of this data visualization. When I lived in Spain (2017-2019), I was paying 15 euros (about 16 USD) a month for a phone plan with 10GB of data. However, when I recently lived in Italy (2022), I was paying 12 euros (about 12 USD) a month for 150GB of data. Personally, I was shocked by the stark difference and I've been wondering about the cost of mobile data ever since. Hence, I was instantly interested in this data visualization. (And imagine my surprise when one of the call-out boxes listed Italy as one of the 5 least expensive countries for 1GB!)

## Step 2: Critique the Visualization

## Step 3: Sketch the Re-design

## Step 4: Test the Solution

## Step 5: Build the Re-design
