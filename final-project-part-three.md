# The final data story

Please view my published website on Shorthand here: [Does school performance change by neighborhood?: A Case Study of Pittsburgh Public Schools](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/does-school-performance-change-by-neighborhood/index.html)

# Changes made since Part II

* **Digital Visualizations:** The biggest changes were to the geographical maps. Previously, I had utilized Datawrapper to create the two maps because I wasn't able to figure out how to render the geographical features on Tableau. However, with help from a peer, I learned how to render the geographical data on Tableau. Then....
* 
* **Narrative Tone & Organization:**

* **Design Choices:**
  
* **Recommendations:** My interviewers seemed to think that my recommendations were good, but they seemed confused by the audience. I think the reason behind the confusion was that policymakers wouldn't necessarily be able to introduce these recommendations. Therefore, I changed my audience to be PPS more specifically. For this reason, I renamed the section to "Next Steps for PPS" instead of "Call-to-Action." Renaming this section also accounted for one of my interviewers' feelings that the sectino title was too dramatic for the situation. Furthermore, I think that this renaming would help people less familiar with the educational scene. While they are not necessarily my audience, it is still important that the material is easily understood by all parties (especially as this information might be relevant for other stakeholders, such as parents or students). One of my interviewers actually had little information about what districts were able to control, and I had to explain that data collection and analysis was a part of their responsibilities. Renaming the section, therefore, should help with that understanding. Last, one of my interviewers and even my Part 2 feedback discussed needing clearer recommendations. Hence, I created bullet points and goals to make the recommendations clearer and more actionable.

## The audience

Orginally, my identified audience was policymakers. However, through my interviews, it became apparent that my my audience wasn't very clear. After being told that my intended audience was policymakers, two of my interviewers said that my language/tone was too exploratory and the third interviewer said that this audience was likely misidentified as policymakers at large wouldn't be too knowledgeable about district-level issues. Upon further reflection, I also came to the conlcusion that my recommendations were ill-suited to policymakers in general. Hence, I decided to narrow down my focus to the Pittsburgh Public Schools district specifically. By better identifying my audience, it became more apparent why I was discussing the limitations of the PPS data dashboards. While this conversation wouldn't be necessary for all policymakers, the PPS district would better understand the need to dive deeper into the data; they would be less likely to dismiss this project as a simple recreation of the work they've already done. Furthermore, specifying my audience allowed me to make more actionable recommendations; I was able to give bullet points with specific measures along with the intended goal for each recommendation. This new audience was also more able to actually implement the provided recommendations; policymakers at large would likely be unable to gather this data (due to FERPA laws) and they would be unlikely to provide additional funding (due to jurisdiction limitations in educational laws). Last, as previously mentioned, I altered the tone of the writing to be more authoritative. The previous exploratory tone made it sound more like an academic paper, which didn't suit my purpose. Since I wanted the PPS district to implement my recommendations, I needed to take on a more credible persona. Hence, I removed a lot of the behind-the-scenes process. Instead, I just explained the necessary processes and data trends that were necessary to tie in my recommendations at the end.
