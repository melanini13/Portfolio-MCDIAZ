# About me

<img width="150" alt="image" src="https://github.com/melanini13/Portfolio-MCDIAZ/assets/156854497/e2ba4cdc-bcd1-460a-9a37-5ca386ec4ee4">

Hello, world! My name is Melanie, and my pronouns are she/her/hers. I am a second-year student in the MS in Public Policy and Management Flagship program at Carnegie Mellon University. After earning a BS in English and a BS in Global Studies at Carnegie Mellon University back in 2017, I worked in the educational field for five years. Through the Fulbright Teaching Assistant program, I spent two years in Spain, teaching various subjects for Grades K-12. Via Teach for America, I spent the following 3 years teaching English Language Arts (ELA, Grades 9-10) and English Language Development (ELD, Grades 9-12) in my hometown of Los Angeles, CA. During my third year of teaching, I simultaneously served as the school's ELD Coordinator, overseeing the reclassification goals of 80 students. It was through my professional experiences as an educator and coordinator that I first developed my skills of project management, data analysis, and community engagement. By further developing these skills through my graduate coursework, I was able to secure the position of Strategy Advisor Summer Associate at Deloitte. Post-graduation, I look forward to returning to Deloitte as a Strategy Consultant in the Government and Public Services (GPS) practice. Outside of my academic and professional goals, you can usually find me reading, doodling, or researching flights to new destinations.

Thank you for joining me on this journey, and please revisit my [portfolio](https://melanini13.github.io/Portfolio-MCDIAZ/) for continuous updates!

# What I hope to learn
During the Spring 2024 semester of Telling Stories with Data (94470), I am interested in learning how to:

- **Give a true voice to the data**  
  I feel that my past academic experience has focused on finding data to fit a preconceived narrative, which hasn't always led to a complete (or a true/correct) portrayal of the data. Therefore, I hope that this course will help me develop an objective stance so that the data can drive the narrative.
  
- **Reduce the distractions/noise in the data visualizations that I create**  
  In both my teaching and consulting experience, I found it very difficult to create effective, stand-alone data visualizations. I want to make my charts/diagrams more accessible so that audiences can independently interpret the story that I am trying to tell.

Moving forward, these skills will play a pivotal role in my professional work as a GPS Strategy Consultant. The clients that we work with rely on us to provide an objective interpretation of data, which will be utilized in decision making processes that affect the lives of real people. Hence, I need to be certain that I am conveying the truth within the data and not twisting it to fit pre-conceived notions -- a malpractice that can actually harm the people that we are attempting to help. Furthermore, my experience as a Summer Associate taught me that oftentimes my data visualizations will be presented to clients in the form of an emailed slide deck rather than a verbal presentation. Therefore, it is vital that I learn to make effective graphics so that my clients' independent interpretation aligns with the story that I aim to convey.
