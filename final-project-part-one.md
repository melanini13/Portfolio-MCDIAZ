# Background

*"Where your student goes to high school matters. For a quality education, send your student to a school in a, b, or c neighborhood. And, no matter what, make sure that they don't attend a school in x, y, or z neighborhood."*

Growing up in the Los Angeles Unified Public School District, it was common to hear statements like the one above. From an early age, my mother had me take the Gifted test so that I could be part of the select few students that had the opportunity to apply to schools outside of my assigned neighborhood school. Majority of students in the public school system don't have such a choice. Many years later, I would return to Los Angeles as an educator at a charter high school. Similar to my experience, my students' guardians saw charter schools as a better alternative to their students' assigned neighborhood schools. Whether true or not, the idea that one's neighborhood could determine the quality of one's high school education persisted. 

When selecting my project, I was really interested in studying Pittburgh Public Schools (PPS). In my preliminary research, I found an article by A+ Schools Pittsburgh which stated the following:
*"By the time students get to high school, we see stark differences in whoâ€™s enrolling in what type of school. In Pittsburgh, the vast majority of Black and Brown PPS students attend neighborhood high schools (many of which have partial magnet programs)."*^1^ This statement, along with my experience as a high school teacher, I decided to look into PPS high school data more specifically. Upon reviewing the data, PPS actually does a good job of providing aggregrate data via dashboards and it also does a good job of providing school-site specific information. However, I thought it was interesting that there wasn't really a way to compare data between the district's school sites specifically. Since the default in PPS is to assign students to neighborhood schools, it is important to have a way to check that school sites have equitable student outcomes. Because, if they don't perform equitably, then the PPS default may be encouraging inequitable student outcomes. 

# Outline 

While the PPS site contains several data sources, I think that it will be best to analyze equity in relation to attendance rates, Math 9 pass rates, graduation rates, and student demographics. I presume that attendance rates will have a negative correlation with graduation rates and Math 9 rates. The logic behind this assumption is that missing more class will negatively impact students' academic performance, which will be represented by Math 9 pass rates and graduation rates. After providing some background info (as included above), the rest of the project outline is as follows:

First, I would like to create a map chart to better understand if there are any apparent regional inequities for the most recent years. (On their website, PPS categorizes their school sites into 4 neighborhood regions: East, South, North/West, Central/Oakland.^2^ Alternatively, PPS also categorizes their school sites into 9 districts.^3^) On this map, I expect to map both Math 9 pass rates and attendance rates. If my assumption is correct, we'll see that the same regions with lower attendance rates will also see the lower Math 9 pass rates. I expect that there will be differences by region, but I'm not exactly sure the extent to which they will differ.

Once I've mapped out the academic performance for the most recent year, I want to gain a historical perspective of the data . So, I'd like to create two line charts to illustrate the historical trends of the following: 1) Math 9 pass rates and 2) attendance rates. However, I will only represent the two lowest performing school sites against the district average. Given that Pittsburgh remains highly segregated, I assume that the historical data will show inequities between neighborhood schools.^4^ However, it will also be important to note that the available data only goes back to 2018, so the inequities may seem more stark now than in pervious years given the impacts of Covid-19. (Since PPS only has five 9-12 high schools, I might end up charting the trend lines for all schools. However, I have yet to decide if I want to add in the five additional 6-12 school sites. Since I am leaning in the direction of including them, I plan to limit the trend to the two lowest performing schools to focus on those facing the worst inequity; I want to avoid a cluttered chart.)

At this point, I think that I will see some correlation between attendance rates and Math 9 pass rates. I would also like to understand if attendance rates are also correlated with graduation rates. At this point I would like to utilize a scatterplot to map the PPS high schools along two criteria: 1) absence rates and 2) graduation rates. I also expect that we would see a negative correlation between these two statistics. (However, given my experience as an educator during the Covid-19 pandemic, I would also not be surprised to see absence rates increasing with little to no change in graduation rates as many schools were more lenient on grading and graduation requirements). If there are regional differences, I think we would see a few outliers in the data and that they would be from one neighborhood or two neighborhoods specifically. I also think that it would be interesting to place a national graduation baseline to see which PPS schools are not meeting the national average. This attribute would really highlight the impact of the inequity between school sites: while some are at or above the average, the others are below it.

The purpose of the concluding chart would be to personalize the data by illustrating who is most harmed by the inequalities of the neighborhood schools. Recognizing the time limitations, I think the most effective way to illustrate this point would be to compare the school site with the highest graduation rates with the school site with the lowest graduatino rates (as indicated by the previous chart). I would then do a side-by-side breakdown of each school's demographics by race, income, and ELL (or Englihs Language Learner) status. (Given my professional experience, these are the 3 demographic categories that are oftentimes the most marginalized in K-12 education systems.) By concluding in this fashion, I think it will become apparent that certain students are probably getting the short end of the stick, which should easily lead to the call-to-action.

While correlation doesn't lead to causation, I think there may be an argument that attendance rates and Math 9 pass rates might be areas of concern in regards to inequity. Therefore, the call-to-action, will be to focus on solutions for these two issues. For instance, the fact that PPS has an online school means that there may be an alternative pathway for students with high absentee rates. Additionally, math supports (e.g., establishing math intervention classes; improved teacher training, etc.) could be a good solution at those school sites that are most impacted.

## In-Class Activity: Telling Your Story with Data

In class, we conducted a process to help us brainstorm an outline for our project. Below, I have provided my responses to this activity, and I hope that it will provide more depth into the outline for my project. 

**One sentence summary:** It's important to ensure that all high schools within the Pittsburgh Public School system are receiving equitable outcomes for their student populations. 
**Audience perspectives & calls to action:**
* As a policymaker, I want to be aware of any equity gaps so that I can ensure that resources are going to the school sites that need it most. I can do this by increasing budgets for community outreach coordinators and math supports at the high schools with lowest attendance and lowest Algebra 1 pass rates.
* As an educator, I want to know how my school site is performing compared to others in the district so that I can make sure my students are getting an equitable educational experience. I can do this by advocating for more Grade 9 math supports and work on parent/student engagement for improved attendance.
* As a guardian, I want to know how my student's school site is performing compared to others in the district so that I can be a better advocate for them. I can do this by working with my student on attendance and advocating for more math supports at their school.
* As a student, I want to know how my student's school site is performing compared to others in the district so that I can be a better advocate for myself. I can do this by attending school everyday and asking for more math supports.

# Method and medium
To create the charts, I intend to use Tableau as it is the software that I am most comfortable with so far. It is possible that I might also utilize Canva as a way to modify the charts that I make. For instance, as there is little customization of the Tableau keys/legends, I might utilize Canvas to create these aspects that accompany the chart. Last, I plan to present my charts via Shorthand because I believe that it is a more dynamic medium that will better engage my audience (as opposed to a static website display).
