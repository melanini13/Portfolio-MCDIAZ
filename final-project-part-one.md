# Outline
> Include a high-level summary of your project.  This should be a couple paragraphs that describe what you're interested in showing with your final project. 

*"Where your student goes to high school matters. For a quality education, send your student to a school in a, b, or c neighborhood. And, no matter what, make sure that they don't attend a school in x, y, or z neighborhood."*

Growing up in the Los Angeles Unified Public School District, it was common to hear statements like the one above. From an early age, my mother had me take the Gifted test so that I could be part of the select few students that had the opportunity to apply to schools outside of my assigned neighborhood school. Majority of students in the public school system don't have such a choice. Many years later, I would return to Los Angeles as an educator at a charter high school. Similar to my experience, my students' guardians saw charter schools as a better alternative to their students' assigned neighborhood schools. Whether true or not, the idea that one's neighborhood could determine the quality of one's high school education persisted. 

When selecting my project, I was really interested in studying Pittburgh Public Schools (PPS). In my preliminary research, I found an article by A+ Schools Pittsburgh which stated the following:
*"By the time students get to high school, we see stark differences in whoâ€™s enrolling in what type of school. In Pittsburgh, the vast majority of Black and Brown PPS students attend neighborhood high schools (many of which have partial magnet programs)."* 



> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear. 

**One sentence summary:** It's important to ensure that all high schools within the Pittsburgh Public School system are receiving equitable outcomes for their student populations. 
**Audience perspectives & calls to action:**
* As a policymaker, I want to be aware of any equity gaps so that I can ensure that resources are going to the school sites that need it most. I can do this by increasing budgets for community outreach coordinators and math supports at the high schools with lowest attendance and lowest Algebra 1 pass rates.
* As an educator, I want to know how my school site is performing compared to others in the district so that I can make sure my students are getting an equitable educational experience. I can do this by advocating for more Grade 9 math supports and work on parent/student engagement for improved attendance.
* As a guardian, I want to know how my student's school site is performing compared to others in the district so that I can be a better advocate for them. I can do this by working with my student on attendance and advocating for more math supports at their school.
* As a student, I want to know how my student's school site is performing compared to others in the district so that I can be a better advocate for myself. I can do this by attending school everyday and asking for more math supports.

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 

Text here...

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.
