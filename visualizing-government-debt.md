# Visualizing Government Debt as a...

## Bar Graph: 

As part of this assignment, we were asked to visualize government debt as a bar graph. My initial bar graph can be found here: [Government Debt as a Bar Graph](https://data.oecd.org/chart/7kr6)

However, I was interested in exploring the data more in-depth to tell a different story, and this led me to rendering the data via a line graph instead. 

## Line Graph:

### How Have the EU Countries with the Greatest Government Debt Faired Since the Covid-19 Outbreak?

AP European History class is the first time that I heard the derogatroy acronym "PIGS" to discuss the EU countries with the highest government debt after the 2008 economic crisis: Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Spain. At the time, I didn't give this economic term much thought, and it would be years before I heard this term again. This past semester, I completed a study abroad program in Milan, Italy. It was here that I heard a group of international students talking about how they believed that the "PIGS" would continue to see rising levels of debt as a consequence of Covid-19 and that this ever-increasing debt would place higher burdens on other EU Member States. So, when I saw the OECD data on government debt, I thought to examine my classmates' assumption. Were they correct or were they just reiterating a negative stereotype that they've also been taught? 

To tell this story, I changed the timespan to include the years 2019-2022 (as opposed to just the latest year of available data, which would render a bar graph). Then, I decided to filter the data to only include countries from the European Union (as this was the key region of focus), and I highlighted the data from Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Spain to better draw attention to their trendlines. I also made the decision to remove the OECD baseline as it didn't feel necessary and I didn't want to distract the viewer's eye.

From this line graph, we see that it is true that these countries did have the highest debt at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic and that they continue to have the highest debt by the end. However, their trend didn't necessarily differ from that of other EU countries. All countries seem to face a rise in government debt from 2019 to 2020 at the height of the pandemic. However, all countries also see a decline in government debt from 2020 onward. Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Spain are no exception. 

Thus, contrary to what my classmates believed, the "PIGS" were not experiencing an economic hardship that was any different than the rest of the EU as a result of Covid-19. In fact, their trend was very similar to the rest of the EU.

In this section, I've represented the OECD Data on government debt via a highlight table with an orange-blue diverging color-scheme. The darkest shades of orange being the highest government debt and the darkest shades of blue being the lowest government debt. They converage at the middle with shades of grey representing middle levels of debt. 

It's important to note that Colombia was filtered out as there wasn't any data rendered over this time period. (However, I didn't include this information as a note as this visualization was practice-driven as opposed to story-driven, so the exclusion didn't really have an impact on the analysis.) Also, the source and citation were added as a subtitle as I couldn't figure out how to add in a new text box on Tableau. I would have liked to place the Source and Citation below the chart, but I notice that the OECD chart that was exported also contained the source at the top of the chart. For this reason, I'm now thinking that it might be better to place the source/citation information between the title and the chart so that it is less likely to be lost in a screenshot as the user would probably require the title as well.

## Whiskers & Box Plot

For this section, I wanted to see what else the data is saying about the government debt of Portugal, Italy, Spain, and Greece. I still wanted to compare their statistics with the rest of the European Union, so I created a filter for those countries. (There were a few EU Member States missing from the data, so I decided to include that in a note under the title. While it made the graphic more cluttered, I felt it was important to add because this missing data could change the analysis if it were added in the future.) 

When deciding on a chart type, the biggest determining factor was the variable of government debt being a ratio. At first, I thought it would be interesting to make a treemap to show a size breakdown of EU debt. But, I realized that this chart type wouldn't be an accurate depiction as the variable is a ratio and not a monetary amount. Because of the relatively small range of the ratio, if I had used a treemap, the debt for each of these four countries would appear to be a smaller size of the EU debt than it actually is. Hence, I ended up trying a whiskers and box plot as it allowed for a comparison between these four countries and the rest of the EU countries in a way that highlighted the interquartile range of the entire EU. I felt that this would be a good way to see how far away these four countries were straying from the EU midspread. I also chose not to create a box plot for every year (so as to avoid more clutter), and just tried to split up the data evenly from 2008 to 2019 in order to help the viewer sense a trend over time.

Since I wanted to highlight these four countries, I did give each one its own color groups and made all the Other EU Member States one color group. This tactic means that the user can hover over the graphic to see how other EU Member States are fairing, but their attention will be kept to the four countries in question. I made the choice not to label the data points for the four countries because it began to feel overwhelming. I also didn't feel that it was really necessary as the whiskers and box plot already provides a visual framing to compare a data point to the midspread -- 50% of the data points lie within the box and, the min and max are at the end of the whiskers, and any points above or below the whiskers become outliers. Hence, there was enough clarity provided by the whisker and box plot that the specific data point labels were unnecessary.

Looking at the data, it is apparent that Portugal, Italy, Spain, and Greece are moving further away from the EU midspread. In fact, Portugal, Italy, and Greece are even presented as outliers by 2019. This outlier status indicates that they seem to be following a different trend than the rest of the EU, which seems to be stabilizing (or even decreasing) their government debt by 2019. Hence, even though the line graph from earlier shows that these four countries followed a similar government debt pattern to other EU countries during Covid-19 (rise between 2019 to 2020, and then a decrease since), this whiskers and box plot shows how these four countries have not been reovering in the same way as the rest of the EU since the 2008 financial crisis. Hence, even though Covid-19 may not have caused them to increase their government debt exponentially (as my classmates thought), these countries are still not decreasing their government debt at the same rate as the rest of the EU, which could still pose a problem for the union's economy long-term.

## Thoughts on the Different Methods of Data Visualization
### Is Making Your Own Data Visualization Worth It?

When trying to tell a simple story that could be told through a line graph or a bar graph, I think it would be sufficient to use data visualizations that are already provided via data sources like the OECD. I found that it took me much longer trying to make the same bar graph that the OECD already had available, so it probably wouldn't be worth the time and energy to recreate the wheel for the sake of doing so. However, via Tableau, we were able to use data visualization methods (e.g., highlight tables and whiskers and box plots) that would not have been possible on the OECD interactive data site itself. Additionally, I was able to add my own titles and additional information (e.g., notes, source, citations) in Tableau while I wasn't able to do so when using the OECD's interactive data. It is also really important to keep the data variables in mind. Because even though Tableau has a lot of visually appealing methods, they aren't necessarily accurate depictions of the variable. Hence, the decision to make your own data visualization should be determined by data type, purpose, and time constraints.

### The Pros and Cons of Each Method

**The Bar Chart:** In my opinion, the bar graph was the least conducive to in-depth story-telling. I might have been able to highlight certain countries, but it didn't allow you to view trends over time. Hence, this method may have been interesting for a regional comparison or a one-country call-out.

**The Line Graph:** When it came to the OECD interactive data, it was great being able to see trends over time. However, I do think that a line graph is only conducive for a short period of time. For instance, while the dataset contained data from 1995-2019, it would have been too confusing to try and track the trends over 2 decades. Hence, a line graph was more conducive to short-term trends or if you only focused on certain years (e.g., every 10th year). Furthermore, it's probably a better option if you have less trendlines. For instance, even using highlight colors for the four countries and greying out the other EU Member States still leaves the chart looking a bit cluttered. 

**The Highlight Table:** Visually, I thought that this graph was the most appealing. I also think that it made a clear distinction between good (blue) and bad (orange) levels of government debt. It also was a good way to track progress over time. I think that it would have been a good way to analyze the EU trends as well, because it would have been just as effective with the locations filtered. This method would have been my top choice in terms of design and clarity.

**Whiskers and Box Plot:** While I think this was the next best option given that the data variable was a ratio, I don't think this version was as effective as the highlight table or even a line graph. While I was able to still maintain an understanding of trend, it's a bit difficult to keep track of the data points for the four countries. This issue was especially true for Spain as it's color was yellow and it was difficult to see when it was within the grey of the IQR area. (However, I didn't change this color because I wanted to maintain the sense of a highlight color and the other color options seemed too muted.) I did like that this method, however, did provide a clear way to see how much more these countries were straying from the EU midspread over time. Hence, I think it has some benefits, but I still would have preferred a highlight table for the purpose of the story being told.
